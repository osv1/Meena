 <h2 class="text-danger" ><b>Incredible convenience:</b></h2>
   <h4  class="text-info">In comparison to a brick and mortar store with fixed hours, online shoppers can choose any time of the day or night to get on the Web and shop. This is especially useful for moms with small children, people that are home-bound, or simply in times of inclement weather; not to mention if you just need to get the item within a certain amount of time and want the absolute most convenient way to go about procuring it.</h4>
  <h2  class="text-danger"><b>Price comparisons:</b></h2>
  <h4 class="text-info">When you visit a store, you most likely have to settle for whatever price the vendor has placed on a particular item. Not so with online shopping - you have the ability to compare prices from hundreds of different vendors (see The Top Nine Comparison Shopping Sites). In addition, many online stores want to keep you as a customer, and offer deep discounts if you sign up for their newsletter; this is a good way to keep apprised of upcoming sales you wouldn't have otherwise known about.</h4>
  <h2  class="text-danger"><b>Infinite choice: </b></h2>
  <h4 class="text-info">Shelf space in a brick and mortar store is limited, which means that your variety of goods is limited. Not so with an online store - the choices are overwhelmingly abundant. Plus, if you don't see what you want in one store online, you can simply move on to the next one - as the consumer, you've got the power to do that.</h4>
